  "quotes": {
    "on_developer_usability": "Developer usability is the most underrated part of API design. You can have the most powerful code in the world, but if developers can't understand and get to 'Hello World' in 5 minutes, you've already lost.",
    "on_technical_debt": "A level of technical debt is healthy, it indicates foresight. I think of technical debt as the unit test that hasn't been written.",
    "on_learning": "You name it I'll learn it. I always do my best work in new programming languages when I don't know what isn't possible.",
    "on_engineering": "As engineers, we're constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible, ensuring our users have access to cutting-edge tools that empower their projects.",
    "on_team_leadership": "The most important part of my role is to get people to disclose their blockers and to highlight where there are problems and embrace them and take them off one person's shoulders.",
    "on_problem_solving": "The most productive team meetings are when someone says they're stuck because someone in the room will have a solution.",
    "on_dotnet": ".NET continues to have some of the smartest minds in language and compiler design in the world investing in it, and Microsoft is backing it.",
    "on_api_design": "If it doesn't show up cleanly in IntelliSense inside Visual Studio, it's not done yet.",
    "advice_to_new_engineers": "My advice to engineers who are starting out is to learn to code in .NET. It's a stable, easily debuggable programming language, and with MAUI, you can now deploy to every device type.",
    "on_modern_standards": "IronPDF stays on the bleeding edge of technology, supporting modern web standards like Flexbox and Razor templating. Many competing products are stuck in the past, but with IronPDF, if the latest browsers support it, we probably do too."
